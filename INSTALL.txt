Dependencies
--------------
pexpect
	This is available for most RPM distributions from DAG:  http://dag.wieers.com/

pyOpenSSL >=0.7
	I've been using 0.8 installed via tarball from Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/project/pyopenssl 
	In theory, it should be possible to create an RPM from this distribution.

VDT:PPDG-Cert-Scripts 
	Certify expects the cert-gridadmin command to be onthe path, so you should add the OSG setup to your shell profile. 


Installation
---------------

If you have root, and are running RHEL 5.X, the easiest	way to use certify would be to install the BNL RPM repo:
  -- Navigate to http://dev.racf.bnl.gov/yum/grid/production/rhel/5Client/x86_64/
  -- wget (or otherwise download) the racf-grid-release-latest.noarch.rpm
  -- Install the RPM. 'rpm -ivh racf-grid-release-latest.noarch.rpm'
  -- You may need to enable the testing repo (edit /etc/yum.repos.d/racf-grid-testing.repo) depending on whether
     a production version of certify is available. 
  
If you don't have root, you can do a home directory install from within this source distribution:
    
    python setup.py install --home=/home/myhomedir
    
(substitution in your own home dir for "myhomedir".) You'll need to confirm the dependencies above are already installed.      

Configuration
----------------

  As a user, you'll then need to set up the config files. Recommended:
  --  mkdir ~/.certify
  --  'cp /usr/share/certify/config/*.conf ~/.certify'  (or from ~/share/certify/config). 
  -- Make sure your cert is at ~/.globus/user[cert|key].pem , and that there is a passphrase. 
  -- Edit certify.conf and set the hostsuri to point at your hosts.conf
  -- Edit hosts.conf and set all the site/individual specific info (e.g. smtp host, email addresses, etc.)
  
  -- The default is to create a self-signed cert, so try that first.
        -- Create a single dummy host section, e.g. [myhost.mydomain.com]
        -- Run 'certify -c ~/.certify.conf -v -L ~/certify.log'
  
  -- Assuming that works, try using the SSHIOPlugin. 
       
    -- Create a real host section, e.g. [myrealhost.mydomain.com]
    -- Set that host to use ioclass=SSHIOPlugin
    -- Be sure ssh-agent is running properly and you can log in to the target host(s)
  
  -- Assuming that works, and you get a notification email, try to automatically create a DOEgrids host cert: 
    -- Confirm that the cert-gridadmin command is set up properly.
    -- Create or edit another real host section. 
    -- Set that host to use adminclass=VDTAdminPlugin
    -- Be sure your DN is registered with grid administrator rights at DOEgrids.

Dependencies
--------------
pexpect
	This is available for most RPM distributions from DAG:  http://dag.wieers.com/

pyOpenSSL >=0.7
	I've been using 0.8 installed via tarball from Sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/project/pyopenssl 
	In theory, it should be possible to create an RPM from this distribution.

VDT:PPDG-Cert-Scripts 
	Certify expects the cert-gridadmin command to be onthe path, so you should add the OSG setup to your shell profile. 
	
Installation
---------------

If you have root, you should be able to make an RPM from within this source distribution:
	
	python setup.py bdist_rpm 

Once installed, the certify command should be on the path and ready to use. 	


If you don't have root, you can do a home directory install from within this source distribution:
    
    python setup.py install --home=/home/myhomedir
    
(substitution in your own home dir for "myhomedir".)     


Configuration
----------------
The program configuration file ~/.certify/certify.conf
